Downloads songs you typed in liedjes.txt

Just found an old project of mine, surprised it still works. This project uses selenium module to download songs through an mp3-converter from youtube. Sometimes your chromedriver is outdated, in that case you have to download a new one.

What do you need for this:

-python installed
-selenium installed
-chrome installed
